# ARFlow Server Examples

The simplest example is [simple](simple/simple.py). You may want to start there!

## Setup

If you're using pip, you should create and activate a virtual environment before
installing any example's dependencies:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you're using Poetry instead, you can just install the dependencies directly,
as shown below.

## Installing the example

Each example is packaged as a regular Python package, with a `pyproject.toml`
file specifying its required dependencies. To run an example, it must first be
installed.

For example, to install dependencies and run the toy `simple` example (which
doesn't need to download any data) run:

```shell
# Using pip:
pip install -e python/examples/simple

# Using poetry:
cd python/examples/simple
poetry install
```

**Note**: it is import to install example in editable mode, which is done using
the `-e` flag (short for `--editable`).

Once installed, the example can be run as a regular Python module:

```shell
python3 -m simple

# or, if you're using poetry:
poetry run simple
```

Examples also declare console script, so they can also be run directly:

```shell
simple
```
