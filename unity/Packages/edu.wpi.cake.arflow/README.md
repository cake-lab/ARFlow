# ARFlow Client

The ARFlow client is responsible for on-device AR data collection and
high-performance AR data streaming. We implement the ARFlow client as a Unity
application that can be easily ported to different platforms and devices.

If you just want the pre-built app, please refer to the
[quick start guide](https://github.com/cake-lab/ARFlow/blob/main/README.md#client-setup).

Otherwise, check out the
[client setup guide](https://github.com/cake-lab/ARFlow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#client-setup)
to build from source and contribute to the ARFlow client.
